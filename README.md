# AdventOfCode
Hi there! These are my attempts to solve the puzzles for AdventOfCode. Due to me currently learning C at my university, I'm trying to solve them each in C.

Feel free to take a look.
Again: Please note, that I'm still new to C and there are probably better solutions to these.

## Notes for each Day:
### Day 1
Really hard. I didn't really know what to do. I couln't get the File I/O to work properly. Out of my frustration, I looked at the answers from
the subreddit. Unfortunatly, I can't seem to find the answer anymore. 

### Day 2
This was way easier than the day before. I really had fun, since I learned a lot after reviewing the code from yesterday. Slowly getting more into it.
